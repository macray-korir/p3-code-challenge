# Phase 3 Week 1 - Toy Problems
This repository contains solutions to the Week 1 Toy Problems for Phase 3. The challenges are designed to test your understanding of various programming concepts such as conditional statements, loops, and string manipulation in Python.

# Challenges
# Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time
Description: This challenge involves converting a 12-hour time format to a 24-hour time format.

Function: convert_to_24_hour(hour, minute, period)

# Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive
Description: This challenge checks if exactly two out of three given integers are positive.

Function: exactly_two_positive(a, b, c)

# Challenge 3: Consonant value
Description: This challenge calculates the highest value of consonant substrings in a given lowercase string.

Function: solve(s)

# Prerequisites
Create a repository on your GitHub account to host your solutions.
Use Python to implement the solutions for each challenge.
Push your solutions to the repository once you're done.
Submit the repository link for grading.
Testing
To test the solutions, you can create test cases by calling the functions with different inputs. You can find example test cases for each challenge in the provided code.

python
Copy code
# Example test cases
print(convert_to_24_hour(8, 30, "am"))  # Output: "0830"
print(exactly_two_positive(2, 4, -3))   # Output: True
print(solve("zodiacs"))                 # Output: 26
Run your Python interpreter or execute the script file containing the solutions to see the output of each test case.
